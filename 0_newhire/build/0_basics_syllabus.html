<h2 id="skills">## Skills</h2>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The ability to wield a terminal and manage state and control flow within a program are mission critical in software development.</p>
<p>NHCC101 assumes the learner has worked with neither, and crash courses some of the most important Linux shell commands while configuring a simple example environment. It then introduces the basic building blocks of software, and leverages shell scripting and python in example projects to apply the learning. This culminates in a crash course on git, and publishing assignment work to Github.</p>
<h2 id="earning-criteria">Earning Criteria</h2>
<p>Completion of the required course actions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attending the workshop sessions.</li>
