<p>The project will be graded on a scale of 0-100, and the final grade will be a weighted average of the above-mentioned criteria.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that this rubric is a sample, it may vary depending on the specific instruction of the course or curriculum. The instructor may also add or remove criteria depending on the project scope or level of the class. Additionally, it’s important that the students are given clear instructions and enough time to gather all the required information, as well as to develop their decision tree and documentation.</p>
