<p>What is the Gang of Four and what are their contributions to the field of design philosophies? How does object-oriented programming (OOP) differ from functional design in terms of approach and benefits? How does data modeling relate to system architecture and design? How does the process of requirements gathering influence the design of a system? How does the relationship between data and architecture impact the overall quality of a system? How can the Gang of Four’s design patterns be applied to improve the design of a system? How does OOP facilitate encapsulation and data hiding in a system’s design? How can functional design be used to improve the modularity and reuse of code in a system? How do the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism function in OOP and how do they impact system design? How do the principles of system architecture and design relate to the maintenance and evolution of a system over time?</p>
