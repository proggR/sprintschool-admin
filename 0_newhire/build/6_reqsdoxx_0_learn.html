<hr />
<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<p>There are several frameworks that can be used for requirements gathering, but one possible framework that can be applied to any project is the “5 Whys” approach. This framework involves asking a series of “why” questions in order to drill down to the root cause of a problem or need. Here is how the process might work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Identify the problem or need</strong>: The first step is to clearly define the problem or need that the project is intended to address. This might involve conducting stakeholder interviews, user research, or analyzing existing data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ask “why” 5 times</strong>: Once the problem or need has been identified, the team can start asking “why” questions to gather more information. For example, if the problem is that customers are not purchasing a product, the team might ask “why” 5 times to gather more information about the root cause of the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why are customers not purchasing the product? (e.g., “They don’t understand the value it provides.”)</li>
<li>Why don’t they understand the value it provides? (e.g., “The marketing materials are not clear.”)</li>
<li>Why are the marketing materials not clear? (e.g., “They are too technical and jargon-heavy.”)</li>
<li>Why are they too technical and jargon-heavy? (e.g., “The product is targeted at a technical audience, so - we assumed that they would understand the technical language.”)</li>
<li>Why did you assume that they would understand the technical language? (e.g., “We didn’t conduct any user research to validate this assumption.”)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Identify potential solutions</strong>: Once the root cause of the problem has been identified, the team can brainstorm potential solutions. These solutions should be specific and actionable, and should address the root cause of the problem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prioritize and select solutions</strong>: The team can then prioritize and select the most promising solutions based on their potential impact, feasibility, and resources required.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gather and document requirements</strong>: Finally, the team can gather and document the requirements for the selected solutions. This should include any necessary user stories, acceptance criteria, and technical specifications.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By following this framework, the team can gather comprehensive and accurate requirements that address the root cause of a problem or need, rather than just the symptoms.</p>

<h2 id="new-service">New Service</h2>
<p><strong>Identify stakeholders</strong>: Identify all stakeholders who will be involved in the project, including the app/service users, developers, and any other parties who will have a stake in the success of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Conduct user research</strong>: Conduct user research to gather information about the needs, wants, and behaviors of the app/service users. This might involve conducting interviews, focus groups, surveys, or user testing.</p>
<p><strong>Define the problem or need</strong>: Define the problem or need that the app/service is intended to address, based on the information gathered from the user research.</p>
<p><strong>Brainstorm solutions</strong>: Brainstorm potential solutions for addressing the problem or need. This might involve sketching out ideas, creating wireframes or mockups, or writing user stories.</p>
<p><strong>Define the data model</strong>: Define the data model for the app/service, including any entities, relationships, and attributes that will be needed to support the required functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Define the processes</strong>: Define the processes that will be used to create, read, update, and delete data within the app/service.</p>
<p><strong>Define the API spec</strong>: Define the API specification for the app/service, including any endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods that will be needed.</p>
<p><strong>Define UX elements</strong>: Define any UX elements that will be needed for the app/service, such as screen layouts, navigation, and visual design.</p>
<p><strong>Gather and document requirements</strong>: Gather and document all of the requirements that have been defined, including the data model, processes, API spec, and UX elements. This should include any necessary user stories, acceptance criteria, and technical specifications.</p>

<h2 id="productrepo-documentation">Product/Repo Documentation</h2>
<p>There are many different categories and subcategories that can be included in the index or table of contents for documentation, depending on the nature of the project and the audience for the documentation. Here are some common categories and subcategories that are typically included in documentation, based on best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Introduction</strong>: This section should provide an overview of the purpose and scope of the documentation, as well as any background or context that is necessary to understand the content.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Getting started</strong>: This section should provide any necessary information for setting up or installing the product or service that is being documented. This might include system requirements, installation instructions, and any necessary configuration steps.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Usage</strong>: This section should provide detailed instructions for using the product or service, including any necessary steps for common tasks or scenarios.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Configuration</strong>: This section should provide information on any configuration options or settings that are available for the product or service, including how to access and modify these settings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Troubleshooting</strong>: This section should provide information and guidance for troubleshooting any issues that may arise while using the product or service.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>API reference</strong>: If the product or service includes an API, this section should provide a detailed reference for all available API endpoints, including request/response formats and any necessary authentication methods.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Glossary</strong>: This section should provide definitions for any technical terms or acronyms that are used throughout the documentation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Index</strong>: This section should provide an alphabetical list of all topics that are covered in the documentation, along with the corresponding page numbers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these categories, it may also be useful to include other subcategories or sections that are specific to the project or the needs of the audience. For example, if the documentation is intended for developers, it may be helpful to include sections on code samples, examples, or technical specifications.</p>

<h2 id="documentation-driven-development">Documentation Driven Development</h2>
<p>Documentation-driven development is a software development approach in which documentation is given a high level of importance throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC). This approach emphasizes the importance of thorough and accurate documentation as a way to facilitate communication and collaboration within the development team, as well as to provide a clear understanding of the project’s goals and requirements.</p>
<p>In a documentation-driven development workflow, documentation is typically treated as a first-class citizen alongside code, and is given equal weight and attention throughout the SDLC. Here is how documentation might be incorporated into each phase of the SDLC in a documentation-driven development workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Planning</strong>: During the planning phase, the development team works with stakeholders to define the goals and requirements for the project, and documents these in a clear and detailed manner. This might include creating user stories, acceptance criteria, or technical specifications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Design</strong>: During the design phase, the development team works to design the architecture and high-level design of the software, and documents these decisions in detail. This might include creating diagrams, models, or prototypes to illustrate the design.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation</strong>: During the implementation phase, the development team writes code and builds the software according to the design that was established in the design phase. The team also documents any design or implementation decisions that are made during this phase, as well as any code that is written.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Testing</strong>: During the testing phase, the development team tests the software to ensure that it is functional and meets the defined requirements. The team also documents any testing that is done, including any test cases, test results, and any defects that are discovered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deployment</strong>: During the deployment phase, the development team deploys the software to a live environment and documents any necessary installation or deployment instructions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintenance</strong>: During the maintenance phase, the development team continues to update and maintain the software, and documents any changes or updates that are made.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By following a documentation-driven development approach, the development team can ensure that all necessary information is captured and documented throughout the SDLC, which can help to facilitate communication, collaboration, and understanding within the team, as well as provide a clear record of the project’s goals and requirements.</p>

<h2 id="businessoperations-documentation">Business/Operations Documentation</h2>
<p>The index or table of contents for internal business/operations process documentation may vary depending on the nature of the business and the processes that are being documented. However, here is an example of what the index or table of contents might look like for this type of documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Introduction</strong>: This section should provide an overview of the purpose and scope of the documentation, as well as any background or context that is necessary to understand the content.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overview of business operations</strong>: This section should provide an overview of the business and its operations, including any relevant organizational structure, processes, and systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Processes</strong>: This section should provide detailed information on all of the business’s processes, including step-by-step instructions, any necessary tools or resources, and any potential risks or issues that may arise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Systems</strong>: This section should provide detailed information on any systems that are used to support business operations, including any necessary user guides or technical documentation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policies and procedures</strong>: This section should provide information on any policies and procedures that are relevant to business operations, including any necessary guidelines, standards, or protocols.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Appendices</strong>: This section should include any additional materials or resources that are relevant to business operations, such as reference guides, templates, or forms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Index</strong>: This section should provide an alphabetical list of all topics that are covered in the documentation, along with the corresponding page numbers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these categories, it may also be useful to include other subcategories or sections that are specific to the business and its operations. For example, if the business has multiple departments or locations, it may be helpful to include separate sections for each of these entities.</p>
