# NHCC105: Intro To Iterative Development

## Agile Development

Agile is a project management approach that values flexibility and collaboration. It emphasizes the ability to adapt to changing requirements and customer needs, and it involves frequent reassessment and reevaluation of priorities. Agile methodologies are designed to help teams deliver high-quality products in a short time frame by breaking projects down into smaller, more manageable chunks called "iterations."

SCRUM is a specific type of Agile methodology that is used for managing and completing complex projects. It was originally developed for software development, but it has since been applied to other fields. SCRUM is based on the principles of transparency, inspection, and adaptation. It involves frequent check-ins, called "sprints," during which team members assess their progress and adjust their plans accordingly.

An iterative development workflow is a process in which a project is developed and delivered in small, incremental chunks called "iterations." Each iteration typically lasts for a short period of time, such as a week or two, and involves the following steps:

- **Planning**: At the beginning of the iteration, the team meets to discuss and plan out the work that needs to be completed. This includes identifying the tasks that will be tackled during the iteration, as well as any dependencies or constraints that need to be taken into account.

- **Development**: During the development phase, the team works on implementing the planned tasks and delivering the agreed-upon deliverables. This typically involves coding, testing, and debugging.

- **Review**: At the end of the iteration, the team reviews the work that has been completed. This may involve code review, testing, and feedback from stakeholders.

- **Reflection**: After the review, the team takes some time to reflect on what went well during the iteration and what could be improved upon in the next iteration. This may involve updating the project roadmap or adjusting the team's approach.

- **Repeat**: The process is then repeated, with the team moving on to the next iteration and starting the cycle over again.

By following an iterative development workflow, teams can deliver functional software in small increments, which allows for more flexibility and allows them to respond to changing requirements or priorities more quickly.

## Agile Education

There is no official "agile education" methodology, but some educators and educational institutions have applied similar principles from the Agile approach to education, either in how education is delivered or in how curricula are developed.

For example, some educators have adopted an "agile teaching" approach, which involves using a flexible and adaptable teaching style that is responsive to the needs and interests of the students. This might involve using interactive, hands-on activities and assignments, as well as incorporating feedback from students into the lesson plans.

In terms of curriculum development, some educational institutions have adopted an "agile curriculum" approach, which involves regularly reassessing and updating the curriculum to ensure that it is meeting the needs and goals of the students and aligns with current industry trends. This might involve breaking the curriculum down into smaller chunks and iterating on it over time, or incorporating feedback from students and industry professionals into the curriculum design process.

It's important to note that these approaches are not formally recognized or standardized, and they may vary in how closely they adhere to the principles of the Agile methodology. However, they demonstrate the potential for applying Agile-inspired principles to education in order to create a more flexible and adaptable learning environment.
