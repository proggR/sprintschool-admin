## Documenting an Undocumented Codebase Assignment

### Description

#### Title: Documenting an Undocumented Codebase

**Objective**: Students will be expected to document an undocumented codebase, including both code comment documentation and a README file providing an overview of the system. The goal of this assignment is to teach students the importance of documentation in software development and how to effectively document code and systems.

**Project Deliverables**:

- Updated codebase with clear and comprehensive code comment documentation
- A README file providing an overview of the system and its functionality

**Assignment Instructions**:

- Students will need to download an undocumented codebase
- Students will need to research and understand the codebase
- Students will need to add clear and comprehensive code comment documentation throughout the codebase
- Students will need to create a README file providing an overview of the system and its functionality
- Students should submit the updated codebase along with the README file

**Assessment Criteria**:

- **Code Comment Documentation (40%)**
    - The code comments are clear, concise, and easy to understand
    - The code comments provide an overview of the code and explain its functionality
    - The code comments are well-organized and easy to follow

- **README File (30%)**
    - The README file provides an overview of the system and its functionality
    - The README file is well-written and easy to understand
    - The README file includes all necessary information such as dependencies and instructions for running the system

- **Codebase Understanding (20%)**
    - The students have a good understanding of the codebase
    - The students are able to clearly explain the functionality of the system

- **Codebase organization (10%)**
    - The codebase is well-organized and easy to navigate
    - The codebase follows best practices and coding conventions

This assignment will be graded on a scale of 0-100, and the final grade will be a weighted average of the above-mentioned criteria.

## Service Documentation Assignment

### Description

#### Title: Service Documentation

**Objective**: Students will be expected to create and document the schema and API for a specified service. The service is described as an e-commerce platform that allows customers to purchase items, manage their orders and track delivery. The students will need to think about the entities, relationships and endpoints that will be needed to make the service work, and create a documentation that clearly explains the schema and API design.

**Project Deliverables**:

- A schema diagram of the service's database
- A document explaining the schema, detailing the entities, relationships, and attributes.
- A document explaining the API endpoints and their functionality, including input parameters and outputs.

**Assignment Instructions**:

- Students will need to research and choose a database management system, and an appropriate schema design tool.
- Students will need to create a schema diagram of the service's database, including entities, relationships and attributes.
- Students will need to create a document that clearly explains the schema, detailing the entities, relationships, and attributes.
- Students will need to research and choose an appropriate framework to implement the API and create a document that explains the API endpoints and their functionality, including input parameters and outputs.
- Students should submit the schema diagram, the schema documentation and the API documentation.

**Assessment Criteria**:

- **Schema design (30%)**
    - The schema is well-designed and normalized
    - The schema reflects the requirements and constraints of the service
    - The schema is easy to understand and can be easily extended

- **API design (30%)**
    - The API is consistent and easy to use
    - The API endpoints are well-designed and meet the requirements of the service
    - The API endpoints are secure and follow best practices

- **Documentation Quality (25%)**
    - The schema documentation is detailed and easy to understand
    - The API documentation is detailed and easy to understand
    - The documentation is well-organized and easy to follow

- **Clarity of expression (15%)**
    - The documentation is clear and concise
    - The documentation uses appropriate terminology and notation
    - The documentation is free of errors

This assignment will be graded on a scale of 0-100, and the final grade will be a weighted average of the above-mentioned criteria.

## Decision Tree and Requirements Gathering Assignment

### Description

#### Title: Decision Tree and Requirements Gathering for Startup Idea

**Objective**: Building on the previous project, students will be expected to create a decision tree and requirements gathering documentation for their startup idea. The decision tree will be used to visually represent the requirements gathering process and decision-making process of the startup. Additionally, the students should also gather information about their market, competitors, and target customers.

**Project Deliverables**:

- A decision tree representing the requirements gathering process for the startup
- A requirements gathering document which includes:
    - Problem statement
    - Market and Competitive Analysis
    - Target customer segment
    - Product and service description
    - Key features and functionalities
    - Constraints and dependencies
    - Acceptance Criteria

**Assessment Criteria**:

- **Clarity and Completeness (30%)**:
    - Decision Tree is easy to understand and presents a logical flow of the requirements gathering process
    - Requirements Gathering Document is complete and covers all the relevant aspects of the startup

- **Analysis (30%)**:
    - The report shows a good understanding of the market and competitive landscape
    - The report effectively defines the target customer segment, problem statement, and solution

- **Structure and Presentation (20%)**:
    - The decision tree and document are structured and easy to follow
    - The report is well-written and easy to understand

- **Feasibility (15%)**:
    - The startup idea is feasible and realistic
    - The decision tree effectively covers all relevant aspects and potential risks for the startup

- **Research (5%)**:
    - The report includes relevant research on the market, competitors, and target customers
    - The report uses appropriate sources and references

The project will be graded on a scale of 0-100, and the final grade will be a weighted average of the above-mentioned criteria.

It's important to note that this rubric is a sample, it may vary depending on the specific instruction of the course or curriculum. The instructor may also add or remove criteria depending on the project scope or level of the class. Additionally, it's important that the students are given clear instructions and enough time to gather all the required information, as well as to develop their decision tree and documentation.
