<h2 id="skills">## Skills</h2>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Knowing how to build doesn’t matter if you don’t know what it is you’re supposed to build. This is where requirements gathering &amp; documentation writing comes into play… at the start.</p>
<p>NHCC106 describes the kinds of questions apt to result in confusion, along with ways to frame questions and follow up that can help refine and clarify the spec being requested. Learners then learn how to take these requirements and turn them into documentation, pre-describing the system being built in as much detail as possible <em>before</em> any code is written.</p>
