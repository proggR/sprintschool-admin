# NHCC106: Intro To Requirements Gathering & Documentation Driven Development

## Skills
-

## Description

Knowing how to build doesn't matter if you don't know what it is you're supposed to build. This is where requirements gathering & documentation writing comes into play... at the start.

NHCC106 describes the kinds of questions apt to result in confusion, along with ways to frame questions and follow up that can help refine and clarify the spec being requested. Learners then learn how to take these requirements and turn them into documentation, pre-describing the system being built in as much detail as possible _before_ any code is written.

## Earning Criteria

Completion of the required course actions, including:

- Attending the workshop sessions.
- Scoring at least 80 points on the final tests.
- Publishing week3 repo to Github.
