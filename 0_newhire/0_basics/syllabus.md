# NHCC101: Intro To Programming & Linux CLI

## Skills
-

## Description

The ability to wield a terminal and manage state and control flow within a program are mission critical in software development.

NHCC101 assumes the learner has worked with neither, and crash courses some of the most important Linux shell commands while configuring a simple example environment. It then introduces the basic building blocks of software, and leverages shell scripting and python in example projects to apply the learning. This culminates in a crash course on git, and publishing assignment work to Github.

## Earning Criteria

Completion of the required course actions, including:

- Attending the workshop sessions.
- Scoring at least 80 points on the final tests.
- Publishing week1 repo to Github.
