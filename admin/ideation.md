# DEIT Sage

## Resources Required
- Discord

- In Browser Terminal/IDE (paired programming)
- Mailing List
- GoToMeeting

-

## Product Offering
- access to Discord to meet other Sage members and learn/work through challenges together, simulating a workplace environment
- predefined projects to guide students through various languages/stacks, adapting offerings to student demand
- monthly "Zany Builds", with hackathons supporting the best zany projects each quarter
- 1hr/month office hours, with 1 on 1 or small group meetings with your Sage (for now myself, but ideally bringing in outside experts as curriculum/project scope expands)
- ad-hoc video lectures supporting new curriculum as curriculum expands, again adapting to student demand. initially myself, but guest lecturers could be arranged with enough demand (some may require added ticket costs if the lecurer costs too much $$$ to budget it into the base subscription cost)
- the ability to take on and trial various hats during projects, including not just development, but PM, business analyst, architect, or any other need that needs filled
- early employment and options access to any zany projects that shift into a real production offering, giving students the opportunity to launch their own startups from the community
- no grading, all skills and portfolio development
- achievement unlocks based on the number of months active

## Pro/Cons

### Cons
- no exit strat... need to be fully committed
- will be a hard sell if localized. possible, but not easy
- will require a herculean effort to compile all necessary resources and starter repos/projects
- will require a brain bending brute forcing of the messaging to make it clear enough to sell
- will require a level of organization that is unnatural (ie: will require Alyssa be involved to help act as the pace maker keeping it alive)
- might be totally shit at it
- will take spends... not sure how much/should be relatively small operationally, but still spends and potentially a fair amount per acquisition (most expensive segment for CAC... cuz of course)
- scaling could be a challenge if I become stretched thin/can't keep up with the rate of change required
- if fails, could be a bad look on my CV

### Pros
- would look ridiculously good on a CV if successful
- I like sharing information/helping people learn
- I like the challenge of taking on the entire relevant/valuable curriculum of SLC, making it better, and then making it active/dynamic beyond that
- if I built it out locally, helping local people start tapping into a better paying field would feel good
- would be a good back to basics to sharpen my own skills being forced to define the entire field
- would give me an excuse to tap back into that Discord to rope it into helping define the Diamond Driven Development path (advanced/future offering)
- would give me a reason to keep hacking at side projects/a sense of purpose behind what would normally be a throwaway, since they could all become starter repos for assignments
- would require full engagement/immersion/socializing from me, which would be a good change of pace, even if challenging to adapt to
- opportunity to leverage it into VC networking
- potential to spin hackathon projects into a startup launch, and subsequently extending the school with a VC fund


## Market Segments
- dev nerds: bread & butter, but also only a component of the offering. start branding here, but include...
- business nerds: the other core segment, targeting startup culture bros who want in at the ground floor and who want to work at a startup
- parents: other than the eager beavers above (and we're talking uber eager... ie: perfect to scoop up into startups eager ;) lol), parents will ultimately be the ones paying/wanting to pay for their kids to gain experience. target campaigns to parents of the 2 above segments
- educators: weirdly, educators know they need to upkeep skills, and might see $100 as worth the risk to stay current. could also help dictate/direct curriculum dev. target educators of technology.
- highschoolers: just a general campaign targeting kids who haven't yet gone to college. might be lower quality, but if targeted cheaply enough to hit big numbers could have its own draw not identified above
- industry switchers:

## Core Branding Hooks
- simulated work environment
- portfolio development
- community driven mentorship
- startup opportunities, both launching and jumping in early
- "Agile Education"
-
## Marketing Ideas To Steal/Dev
- video content, at least a teaser/trailer
- mascot incorporated into the experience
- make up a campus/find a virtual space worth considering to have a pretend one
- find stakeholders who can help promote
- media attention
- chatbots (really dumb... but could be funny)
- scheduling software
- miracles & miseries

## Lame Initial Campaign/Tagline Attempts
- a new way to learn; on the job (counter: its not a job cuz they're not getting paid, find new word)
- Outdated pedagogies can't keep up with technology. Introducing Agile Education, the model built to adapt.
- Dream of the startup life but not sure where to begin? DEIT Sage is part agile education mentorship, and part startup incubator. Join our monthly "zany builds" and pitch your ideas for future builds, with quarterly hackathons to support the best zany projects.
- Bootcamps are expensive, shallow, and increasingly less beneficial to a developer's CV. What will forever be beneficial? Portfolio and experience. With DEIT Sage, students develop both, providing a foundation ready for real work environments for a fraction of the cost of bootcamps. Upgrade your CV in your pajamas today.
