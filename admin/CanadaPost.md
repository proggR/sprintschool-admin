I'm hoping to launch a training program for developers, and would ideally like to keep the members of early cohorts all from my general region (Quinte West, but targeting Belleville and surrounding area more generally). Attempting to assess potential market size, optimistically from a population of ~70k I might have ~500-1000 potential customers, and need to fill 16 seats, but will need to find a way to successfully target those 1000 in order to keep the required penetration rate low enough to be feasible within budget. If I expand proximity to include west to Brighton, north to Madoc, and East to Napanee I might optimistically have 1000-1500 distributed randomly over the region.

I have 2 segments of priority atm that I'm curious if Canada Post's targeted mailing could help with, and what that might cost.

Segment 1: people ~18-25 who haven't yet gone to college, but are interested in either software/technology, or startups/business, ideally who are working part time (not sure how you could know that, but sessions will be held Mondays and Wednesdays, so availability would favor part timers who might have open timeslots).

Segment 2: local small businesses with a digital presence critical to their success who might be interested in training opportunities for their staff.
