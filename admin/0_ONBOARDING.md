- How long would you like to continue education in this field? [select]

- How many hours/week are you able to actively commit to assigned coursework? Intended to be casual paced, but with milestones to hit that will require some commitment to the schedule, especially beyond the "New Hire" foundational learning when group work becomes the default mode as part of the simulated workplace.

- Availability: Mondays & most Wednesdays will contain live workshops, time TBD. These sessions will be recorded, but would ideally have participants to ask questions as they emerge. Mondays will also contain Standup sessions, which will capture updates from the previous work, and lay out the focus of the current week, while also making any announcements. These will be kept short to start and attendance is strongly preferred. Team standup attendance is required (will be determined among the small groups). Describe your availability Mondays and Wednesdays, along with availability for Tuesday and Thursday. Friday is Funday where participation is frivolous and just for idea gen and random non-coursework Q&A/chatter. [textarea]
