## Describe current business activity

Software R&D, now pivoting into offering an education and training program.

## What would you like help with?

While I know I'm not technically near Kingston (depending on what qualifies as "near"), I lived there for 6 years, long term would like to move closer, and have worked with QBLC once nearly a decade ago with positive results (sourced.fm was the project if you still have it on file somewhere). I'm also more than happy to travel there for any in person needs.

I've conjured up an idea and the bulk of a prototype for it, but atm don't know where else to turn to fill in some of the gaps needed to launch as a properly structured organization. I'd like to launch an education/training offering under the brand SprintSchool, which will be a wholly owned subsidiary of my R&D project DEIT (Digital Estate Investment Trust; deit.ca).

To date DEIT hasn't been incorporated because its had no revenue/expenses associated with it, but if I'm taking SprintSchool seriously I'll need to figure out the best structure for the 2 entities. I imagine DEIT, like the name suggests, being a trust, simply holding its stake in various subprojects and investments, but I have no experience working with trusts, companies in their holdings, or the tax implications of that model. Being the only owner, and the only full time staff to start I'll want to aim to minimize double taxation while being able to draw a pay from the company.

If I'm already spending on DEIT, I'd also like to inquire about trademark costs/process for DEIT and "Digital Estate Investment Trust" given that phrase was unique online when I claimed the name, so I'd like to firm up my claims to the brand.

Any advice or reference materials you could point to would be a huge help. And any cost breakdown to the filing fees and tax schedule for a structure like this would help as I refine budget projections. If I pursue this project I'll need to get filing taken care of (likely for both entities, unless I'm mistaken). And if I don't due to budget hiccups or some other discovered flaw in the model, I will at some point be incorporating DEIT as it shifts into production oriented products/services, so understanding the structure/costs better will be a huge help.

## How long operated?

DEIT has been a moonlit project for 3 years, while SprintSchool is a fresh project.

## How long profitable?

It hasn't shifted into revenue generation oriented projects until now.


## What are the sources of start-up money for your business (e.g. investors, bank loan, savings)? Briefly explain: 

Most expenses I can avoid until I've secured the first cohort's first month payment, which by current (not final) budget projections should cover the bulk of the annualized billing services within the first month, and any per-user billing is covered within the monthly subscription fee. For moments when spending is needed before funds are received (which should only be the initial standup phase effecting cohort 1), I have a LoC with more than enough credit to tide over the costs. If the project remains successful/viable into cohorts 2 and 3, I have investments I could consider tapping to provide some additional resources, and would consider taking on new loans to underwrite larger expansion of service projects.

There's also a few angles that leverage VCs, including organizing guest trainer sessions ran by VCs, and pitch days that allow students and members of the community to come pitch to a panel of VCs pulled in after networking (like a regionally focused annual Dragons Den/Shark Tank model). "Zany Hackathon" projects could at a future point produce viable software that ends up seeing a production release as well, which adds another angle where VC money could be found to seed those nascent student built projects, pivoting from education/training into something more like a startup incubator with skills upgrading baked into its core as the talent pool grows/permits.
