### Smol Market

Marketing a 10-week software engineering crash course to a local audience of ~70,000 people that skews older can be challenging as the community may not have a high demand for this type of service. However, it's worth noting that even though the community skews older, it doesn't mean that there's no interest in software engineering among this group of people.

It's hard to estimate the possible audience size for this service without more specific information about the community and their interest in software engineering. However, you can use market research and targeting methods to identify and reach potential students.

One strategy you can try is to conduct market research to understand the needs, interests, and behaviors of your target audience. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, or interviews to learn more about the community's experience and interest in software engineering. You can also analyze data from social media and online forums to identify patterns and trends in the community's interests and behaviors.

Once you have a good understanding of your target audience, you can use targeted marketing and advertising to reach potential students. For example, you can use social media, online forums, and local publications to advertise your course and reach a specific audience. You can also use search engine optimization (SEO) to ensure that your course appears high in search engine results when people in the local community search for software engineering courses.

Additionally, it would be beneficial to have a landing page or website where potential students can find more information about the course, it's contents, and the instructors. You can share testimonials and success stories of previous students to increase credibility.

To summarize, while it is challenging to reach a local audience, with a specific niche like software engineering, by conducting market research, using targeted advertising and using a clear and professional landing page you can potentially reach a significant number of interested individuals in your community.

### Interest In General

It's difficult to provide an exact percentage of the general population that has an interest in programming, as this can vary depending on the region, age group, and demographic. However, market research studies on this topic can give us an idea of the potential interest in programming among the general population.

A report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the US, estimates that the number of jobs in computer and information technology is projected to grow 11 percent from 2019 to 2029, much faster than the average for all occupations. Furthermore, it states that software development jobs alone are projected to grow by 21% over that period.

A recent survey by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the US found that 9.5% of undergraduate students in the 2018-2019 academic year were enrolled in computer and information science majors.

A survey by the European Commission in 2020 shows that 8.3% of the EU population aged 16-74 have the skills in coding or programming and an additional 7.3% have an interest in learning.

These statistics suggest that there is a significant portion of the population that has an interest in programming and software development, and that this interest is increasing over time. However, this data is primarily focused on the US and EU, it's worth noting that the interest in programming may vary in different regions and countries.

It's also worth noting that having an interest in programming or software development doesn't necessarily mean that someone will be interested in continuing education specifically in programming. Therefore, targeted marketing and advertising can help you reach the specific group of people that are looking for the type of education you're offering.
