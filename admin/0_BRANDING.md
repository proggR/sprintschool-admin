## Agile Education for a rapidly evolving digital workplace

College and University programs are outdated before they start, and Bootcamps are wildly expensive, generally shallow and increasingly passed over by recruiters. How can the next generation of software engineers keep up and remain relevant to employers?

Introducing Agile Education, a new methodology for training full stack software development and management of the SDLC. Start with an intensive foundational "New Hire" introduction program encompassing a full college education within 10 weeks, and then you begin your guaranteed work placement at our corporate partner FakeCo (note: FakeCo is not a real company).

## Fake Company, Real Experience

While FakeCo may not be real _per se_, the work you'll be doing once you've completed the New Hire program will be, as will be the experience you gain as you wear many hats, and take on more responsibility as you progress. While reviews and quizzes will be used, grades are not the priority. Portfolio development & workplace experience operating within a team are the objectives of SprintSchool/FakeCo, because those are what recruiters/employers are looking for most. Develop common types of applications and services using multiple languages and stacks, rotating roles & responsibilities and gaining valuable work experience as part of a team as you do.

## Affordable Membership, No Commitments, and Early Bird Pricing

Education and skills development is an investment, but shouldn't be one that's all or nothing and breaks the bank. Aiming to work for both the casual learner and the more ambitious and career oriented learners, SprintSchool bills monthly for as long as you choose to continue learning with us, with a dynamic and evolving curriculum built around an ever growing catalog of toy applications and services that all add to your portfolio and work experience. If/when you've outgrown the service, simply make a submission through our cancellation form, and your membership will be terminated along with any future billing, no questions asked (other than what's asked in the cancellation form that is, which is simply collecting feedback so we can improve).

Cohorts are kept small at 12 new members per-cohort to help form functional teams and work relationships. For the first 2 cohorts, the service will be billed at the Introductory Phase price of $150/month. Through the Expansion Phase of cohorts 3 & 4, the service will bill at $200/month. From cohorts 5 onward, the full price of $250/month will apply. Full learner cohorts remaining 12, but a New Hire only offering that allows for larger groups taking the foundational crash course may also be offered starting around Cohort 5.

## The Zany Thing is... FakeCo Might Not Stay Fake

With monthly "Zany Builds" (full featured applications/service prototypes), and quarterly "Zany Hackathons" (intensive 2 day all hands on deck sessions throwing into a shared project), FakeCo will be a very busy place for a fake company. It also might just accidentally make some very real software along the way. Because of this, SprintSchool will give preference to learners interested in/pursuing a career path in startups. Jump into the zany_pitch channel on one of our Friday Fundays and pitch your startup idea, and you might get a chance to see it built.
